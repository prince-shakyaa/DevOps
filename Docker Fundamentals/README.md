# Topic: Docker Fundamentals - six Hello World containers

The same "Hello World" page served six different ways, each with its own Dockerfile. All six
images were built and run together on one machine; the screenshots are from that run.

## Section: Topic: Layout

```
Docker Fundamentals/
├── nodejs-app/    Node.js 20, built-in http module, no dependencies
├── python-app/    Python 3.12 + Flask
├── java-app/      Java 21, JDK's built-in HttpServer, compiled during the build
├── Apache-app/    httpd 2.4 serving a static page
├── React-app/     React 18 + Vite, built in stage 1, served by Nginx in stage 2
└── nginx-app/     Nginx serving a static page
```

## Section: Topic: Ports

Each container listens on its natural port. Host ports were chosen to avoid clashes. Port 5000
on macOS is taken by AirPlay Receiver, so Flask is exposed on 5001, and ports 3000/3001 were
already in use by a local dev server, so Node is exposed on 3002.

| App | Image tag | Container port | Host port | URL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Node.js | `nodejs-app` | 3000 | 3002 | http://localhost:3002 |
| Python / Flask | `python-app` | 5000 | 5001 | http://localhost:5001 |
| Java | `java-app` | 8080 | 8080 | http://localhost:8080 |
| Apache | `apache-app` | 80 | 8081 | http://localhost:8081 |
| React | `react-app` | 80 | 8082 | http://localhost:8082 |
| Nginx | `nginx-app` | 80 | 8083 | http://localhost:8083 |

## Section: Topic: Build and run everything

From this directory:

```bash
# executed command block
docker build -t nodejs-app ./nodejs-app
docker build -t python-app ./python-app
docker build -t java-app   ./java-app
docker build -t apache-app ./Apache-app
docker build -t react-app  ./React-app
docker build -t nginx-app  ./nginx-app

docker run -d --name hello-node   -p 3002:3000 nodejs-app
docker run -d --name hello-python -p 5001:5000 python-app
docker run -d --name hello-java   -p 8080:8080 java-app
docker run -d --name hello-apache -p 8081:80   apache-app
docker run -d --name hello-react  -p 8082:80   react-app
docker run -d --name hello-nginx  -p 8083:80   nginx-app

docker ps --filter name=hello-
```

Tear down:

```bash
# executed command block
docker rm -f hello-node hello-python hello-java hello-apache hello-react hello-nginx
```

## Section: Topic: Notes on each Dockerfile

**nodejs-app** - `node:20-alpine`, copies `package.json` and `app.js`, runs `node app.js`.
There is no `npm install` because the http module ships with Node. `.dockerignore` keeps
`node_modules` out of the build context.

**python-app** - `python:3.12-slim`. Requirements are copied and installed *before* the
application code so the pip layer is cached when only `app.py` changes. Flask binds to
`0.0.0.0`, otherwise it would only listen inside the container.

**java-app** - `eclipse-temurin:21-jdk`. `javac Main.java` runs at build time, so the image
contains the compiled class. The server uses `com.sun.net.httpserver`, which is part of the
JDK, so there is no Maven or Gradle to set up.

**Apache-app** - `httpd:2.4`. One `COPY` into `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/`.

**React-app** - two stages. `node:20-alpine` installs dependencies and runs `vite build`;
`nginx:alpine` copies the resulting `dist/` folder. The Node toolchain never reaches the final
image, which is why `react-app` and `nginx-app` end up almost the same size.

**nginx-app** - `nginx:alpine`. One `COPY` into `/usr/share/nginx/html/`.

## Section: Topic: Image sizes from the run

| Image | Size |
|---|---|
| nginx-app | 102 MB |
| react-app | 102 MB |
| nodejs-app | 194 MB |
| apache-app | 205 MB |
| python-app | 234 MB |
| java-app | 744 MB |

The Java image is large because it carries a full JDK. Swapping the runtime stage to a JRE image
or using `jlink` would shrink it considerably; that is the same idea the React build uses.

## Section: Topic: Verifying with curl

Five of the six return `<h1>Hello World</h1>` straight from `curl`. The React app returns an
HTML shell with a `<script type="module">` tag; the heading is rendered by JavaScript in the
browser, which is why the browser screenshot is the real check for that one.

## Section: Topic: Screenshots

Build, run, `docker ps`, `curl` checks and image sizes:
